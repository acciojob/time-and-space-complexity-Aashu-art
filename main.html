    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

    <!-- First paragraph explaining Time Complexity -->
    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the size of its input. An efficient algorithm is one that minimizes this time complexity, making it ideal for handling larger inputs without significant performance issues.</p>

    <!-- Second paragraph explaining Space Complexity -->
    <p>Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. An algorithm with space complexity of <b>Space Complexity</b> O(n) implies that the memory used grows linearly with the input size. This is important for managing large datasets where memory usage is a concern.</p>
